# ArrayList Questions

In Java, many array-based questions can be solved using ArrayLists, and vice versa.
Since they are often interchangeable (with some adaptation), this directory doesn't
contain many separate ArrayList questions - most array solutions can be adapted
for ArrayLists by modifying the syntax accordingly.

### Key Differences to Remember:
- Arrays: Fixed size, use `arr[index]` syntax
- ArrayLists: Dynamic size, use `list.get(index)` and `list.set(index, value)`

Most array solutions in the parent directory can be adapted for ArrayLists.
